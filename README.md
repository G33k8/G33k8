**Robotics & Embedded Systems | BITS Pilani Goa**

I’m an undergraduate in **EEE + Biological Sciences** at **BITS Pilani, Goa**, and most of what I build runs on real hardware. My work sits at the intersection of robotics, embedded systems, and low-level tooling—usually driven by the idea that if something can be automated, it should be.

---

## What I’m working on lately

- Built a **Jetson-powered perception stack** using **YOLOv11** for real-time environmental feature detection on low-power hardware.  
- Wrote **Python drivers** to interface **LiDAR and camera modules** for autonomous decision-making.  
- Managed **embedded Linux deployments**, scripted telemetry, and added reliability tooling for field testing.  
- Working on **GPS-denied UGV navigation**, combining **SLAM** and **deep learning** for mapping and planning.

---

## Side projects & experiments

Outside robotics, I occasionally publish small utilities or experiments:

- A **mess-menu PWA for BITS Goa** with offline support and automated Python-based deployment.  
- **UI/UX design work** for institute fest applications.  
- Random scripts, prototypes, and tooling experiments.

---

## Background

Before this, I spent **two years doing QA for Opera GX**, where I worked on identifying UI bugs, edge cases, and performance issues, and wrote structured technical reports for the engineering team.

---

Most of what lives here is messy, exploratory, and built without expectations—just things I wanted to try, learn from, or automate.
