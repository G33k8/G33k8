**Robotics & Distributed Systems | BITS Pilani Goa**

I’m an undergraduate in **Mathematics and Computing** at **BITS Pilani, Goa**.

## What I’m working on lately

-Built and deployed a Jetson-based perception and SLAM stack using RTAB-Map for real-time mapping and localization on resource-constrained hardware.

-Integrated LiDAR and vision pipelines with ROS 2 Nav2, writing Python nodes and drivers to support autonomous navigation and goal execution.

-Working on GPS-denied UGV navigation, focusing on SLAM–planning integration, inter-node communication, and system reliability across distributed processes.

Most of what lives here is messy, exploratory, and built without expectations—just things I wanted to try or learn from.
